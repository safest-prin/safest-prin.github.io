A *Digital Twin (DT)* is a virtual, high-fidelity model of a **physical system** (Physical Twin), connected via continuous two-way data exchange. It helps manage complex systems by enabling analysis, design, control, and adaptation across various domains. In Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPSs), DTs simulate medical devices and processes to support real-time decision-making, risk assessment, and medical training. They can model also **humans** like patients (or part of them) and doctors. However, challenges like modeling human behavior, managing uncertainty, and ensuring data security hinder DT adoption in healthcare. The SAFEST project addresses these challenges to enhance the reliability and implementation of DTs in MCPSs.

Scientific goals of the SAFEST project are in line with the following missions of the Italian national plan on Recovery and Resilience (PNRR), more precisely mission 1.2 “Digitisation, innovation and competitiveness of the production system”, mission 6.2 “Innovation, research and digitisation of healthcare”, and mission 4.2 “From research to business”
